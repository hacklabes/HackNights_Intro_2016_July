# Computer Programming

## Starting

### Computer Programming

"Computer programming (often shortened to programming, sometimes called coding) is a process that leads from an original formulation of a computing problem to executable computer programs".
The Source code is written in one or more programming languages. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate performing a specific task or solving a given problem. The process of programming thus often requires expertise in many different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms and formal logic."

[Computer Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming)


### Source Code
In general, a text file with a collection of instructions written using some human-readable computer language.

[Source Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code)

### Computer Language

"A programming language is a formal constructed language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms."

[Computer Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_language)

### Algorithm

"...is a self-contained step-by-step set of operations to be performed""

[Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm)

### Compiler
 
"A compiler is a computer program that transforms source code written in a programming language into another computer language. The most common reason for converting source code is to create an executable program. "

### Interpreters

In computer science, an interpreter is a computer program that directly executes, i.e. performs, instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without previously compiling them into a machine language program. An interpreter generally uses one of the following strategies for program execution:

### Syntax

"The set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be a correctly structured document in such computer language"

[Syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages))

### Debugging 

The process of finding and resolving bugs or defects that prevent correct operation of computer software"

## P5.js
[Reference](http://p5js.org/reference/)


### Syntaxe:

Comments:
```java
// Comments
// 

/* Block Comments within /* */ 


*/

```
### Functions:

```java
void function();
void function(float parmameter1,float parameter2);
void function(float parmameter1,float parameter2,float parameter3);
```

### Expressions
